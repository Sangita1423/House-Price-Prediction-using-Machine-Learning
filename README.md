# House-Price-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning

## Goal

It is my job to predict the sales price for each house. For each Id in the test set, I must predict the value of the SalePrice variable. 

## Metric

Submissions are evaluated on Root-Mean-Squared-Error (RMSE) between the logarithm of the predicted value and the logarithm of the observed sales price. (Taking logs means that errors in predicting expensive houses and cheap houses will affect the result equally.)

## Submission File Format

The file should contain a header and have the following format:

Id,SalePrice
1461,169000.1
1462,187724.1233
1463,175221
etc.
